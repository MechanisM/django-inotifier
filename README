django-inotify - a thin django wrapper around pyinotify

Author: Jay Wineinger <jay.wineinger@gmail.com>

This project provides a django app which is intended to be pluggable into any
other project.  When configured and running, pyinotify is used to monitor a
file or directory for changes. When changes are detected, a corresponding 
django signal will be issued and can be handled by other apps.
